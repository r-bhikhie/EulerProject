# Problem 004

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

##
# Upper bound for numbers = 999
# Lower bound for numbers = 100
# max_product = 998001
# min_product = 10000
#
# use typecasting to break up strings in the middle?
